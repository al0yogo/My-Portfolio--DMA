# My-Portfolio--DMA


It is still a work in progress, but 580 lines of code later I have the base for my project. The goal is to develop a program that can take two pieces of handwriting and compare them, to test if they were written by the same person. To do this I hope to use the linguistics used, the font unique to each person, the year the notes were written, and so on. Eventually, I would like to take this project to an auditory workspace, and compare recordings to test if it is the same voice based on pitch, speed, tone, vocabulary, emphasis, and so on. Of course the code I have currently can be optimized, and is incredibly messing as I am still learning and finding my way aroundd Data science and Machine learning (which I hope to incorporate a lot more in the future), but I am proud of what I have been able to learn and accomplish in these first 2 months. 


The main file, that is the most operable file is: "imageofsentence.py"
